We encourage any user of K to contribute with examples to our distribution.
If you have any interesting K definition that you believe is worth showing
to all people who download K, be it a language definition or an algorithm
implemented in an elegant or interesting way thanks to K's capabilities,
please do not hesitate to contact us at info@k-framework.org.

In order for a K definition to be included in the distribution, for
uniformity we strongly recommend that certain conventions be respected:

1) Include a README.tex file, which should work when `kompile` is called
with the -topmatter option.  The README.tex file should include a title
and one or more authors, with their email addresses.  Take a look at
existing README.tex files and try to follow the same format and conventions.
If the defined language is not invented by you, make sure you include
appropriate citations to the inventor of the language; if you don't do that,
since your name appears as the author of the K definition, other users may
wrongly believe that you invented that language.

2) Use sections, subsections, etc., in comments in your definition, because
these turn into bookmarks in many PDF viewers, thus allowing users to browse
your definition more easily.

3) Do not exceed 80 characters per line.  Even though most editors are able
to smoothly deal with long lines, some editors are not.  Moreover, some
people look at definitions by browsing the svn repository with a browser,
or by using a web interface; long lines look bad in these.

4) Add as many comments as possible into your definition.  Feel free to
refer to other existing definitions if you do not want to re-explain
language features which have already been explained by others.
