# Default behavior is to blacklist everything else. Note that neither whitelisting or blacklisting are
# recursive, e.g. whitelisting <thread> wont whitelist all of its children

# Current features:
#   whitelisting
#   keep only a certain number of lines
#   recursive hide
#   colors
#   global string replacement --- now with regular expressions
#   keepChars - keep only so many characters per line
#   option to remove spaces in the cell membranes
#   operator parsing, and pretty printing
#   infixify
#   specify line endings

# Upcoming features:
#   yaml parse errors
#   environment/memory lookup
#   regular-expression based line-based show/hide
#   arbitrary global and local string-replacement rules
#   local and global regular-expression based styling (bold, underline, color, etc)
