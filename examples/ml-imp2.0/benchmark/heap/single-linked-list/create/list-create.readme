1. The nodeList structure is defined in order to express single linked lists.

2.The precondition : the function works on a list received as argument.
The postcondition: the function call creates anew list with the same content as 
the first one, leaving the rest of the heap unaltered. It returns a pointer to 
the first element of the new list.
The invariant: iterx is the pointer that iterates the list received as argument 
(the heap is split into the list segment- first elements of the original list 
and the rest of the list land it constructs the new list by copying the content 
element by element (creating a list segment and a pointer the the latest element 
to be added to the copy-list). The list segment of the original list and the 
list segment concatenated with the pointer represent the same content.
