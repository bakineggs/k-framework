1. The "sum" function computes th sum for the first n natural numbers.
The main function calls the absolute function for different arguments.

2. The precondition: n is bound to a natural value and is greater than 0.
The postcondition: the returned value is the sum of the first n natural numbers.
The invariant: n is added to the sum and then decreased until it reaches 0.
The last comments of the file contain declarations that are used by the tool.
