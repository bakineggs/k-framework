1. The "fact" function returns the factorial value for the one received as 
argument(int fact(int n)). The function is not recursive.
The main function calls the fact function and tests the result.

2. The precondition states that the argument "n" has to be bounded in the 
environment to the "n0" value and that the n0 value is greater than 0. This 
examples does not involve working with heaps. 
There are no extra conditions imposed.
The postcondition: the environment is irrelevant(it is matched by ?rho). The 
returned value is the factorial one.
The invariant: each succesive factorial is computed for iterator until the value 
of iterator reached that of the variable received as argument.
