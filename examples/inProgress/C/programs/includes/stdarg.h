/*
 * stdarg.h
 *
 * Provides facilities for stepping through a list of function arguments of
 * an unknown number and type.
 *
 * NOTE: Gcc should provide stdarg.h, and I believe their version will work
 *       with crtdll. If necessary I think you can replace this with the GCC
 *       stdarg.h (or is it vararg.h).
 *
 * Note that the type used in va_arg is supposed to match the actual type
 * *after default promotions*. Thus, va_arg (..., short) is not valid.
 *
 * This file is part of the Mingw32 package.
