IoXML version 0.8
-----------------

- [14 Nov 07] Updated for Camlp5 (transitional and strict).

IoXML version 0.7
-----------------

- [05 Jul 07] Updated for OCaml 3.10 and Camlp4s.
- [14 Nov 02] Added ifdef to allow compiling with new format type.
- [29 Oct 02] Changed IoXML.xprint_string and IoXML.xparse_string:
  the characters < > & " ' of the string are converted according to
  the XML rules: &gt; &lt; and so on.
- [17 Jul 02] Added IoXML.xparse_nativeint and xprint_nativeint.

IoXML version 0.6
-----------------

- [24 Apr 02] Changed generation of parsing and printing functions of
  "types manifest", e.g.:
       type t = A.t = A | B
  In this case, now generates the functions from the type definition A | B,
  instead of calling the parsing and printing functions of of the module A.
  This avoids having to compile a.ml with pa_ioXML.
- [18 Mar 02] Fixed bug: did not input identifiers holding digits.

IoXML version 0.5
-----------------

- [10 Feb 02] Enclose array items by tag "ai", list items by tag "li",
  tuple items by tag "ti" and constructor parameters, if there are at
  least two parameters, by tag "ci".
- [04 Feb 02] Added option -onepr in pa_ioXML.cmo: in printers, generate
  one xprint with a possible big string format (which is shorter when pretty
  printed), instead of a sequence of prints with small formats (which
  is more readable).
- [04 Feb 02] Changed the internal XML lexer (faster and using less memory).

IoXML version 0.4
-----------------

- [03 Feb 02] Some perestroika of code. Some printing functions are
  expanded differently.
- [02 Feb 02] Added inline generation for tuples of size > 5.
- [02 Feb 02] When a function type is encountered, generates now
  the function without the IoXML prefix in order to allow the user
  to provide his own version.

IoXML version 0.3
-----------------

- [02 Feb 02] Now, in case of not implemented predefined type, a warning
  is sent and no parsers and printers are generated for the defined type.
- [02 Feb 02] Fixed bug: the code generated for abstract types in ml
  files was bad.
- [02 Feb 02] Added parser/printer for type ref, tuples of 4 and
  5 elements, and for declaration of type with manifest.

IoXML version 0.2
-----------------

- [02 Feb 02] The user application does not need any more to be linked
  with the gramlib.cma of camlp4. In case of exception raised, it is
  now encapsulated inside the exception IoXML.ExcLoc (instead of
  Stdpp.Exc_located before).
- [02 Feb 02] The functions parse_xml and parse_xml_list are implemented
  now with stream parsers (instead of camlp4 extensible grammars before),
  and are therefore much faster.
- [02 Feb 02] Added missing functions for bool, char and float. Fixed bug
  in xparse_string: missed parsing of backslashes and evaluation of string
  contents. Renamed some IoXML library functions (internal usage).

IoXML version 0.1
-----------------

- [01 Feb 02] First release
