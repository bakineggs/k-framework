  A meta-model consists of a configuration including 
     - the classes together with their relationships and
     - the OCL constraints, 
  and the set of rules describing the dynamic of the models.
  A model is represented by a cell including instances of the classes. For each instance, we have
  cells with the name of the instance, the name of the class owner, and the values of the attributes.

/*
  A configuration for a metamodel consists of two cells: one for classes and one for OCL constraints.
  The cell for classes is similar to that used in the definition of SKOOL and includes three cells: 
  name of the class, name of the immediate ancestor (=object if it is a base class), and a cell for
  the attribute declarations. The types of the attributes are specified as labels (meta-representation).
  The associations between classes are represented by attributes describing the roles, where the type
  of the attribute is chosen according to the multiplicity.
  The cell for OCL constraints includes a list of formulas.
