\section*{Abstract}
This is the \K semantic definition of the System F type system (i.e., its static semantics). System F extends simply-typed lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism. It adds type variables, which can be universally quantified, and type instantiations to the language. All polymorphic expressions must be instantiated explicitly in this language.
