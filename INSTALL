The installation of K consists of three steps: installing and checking the prerequisites, downloading and saving the k-framework directory for your platform, and finally configuring and testing K.


More instructions on writing, compiling, and executing K definitions can be found in the README file.

Detailed instructions
---------------------


1) Prerequisites:

- GNU make --- to be able to take advantage of the Makefiles provided with the example definitions
- Perl --- as our compilation scripts are written in Perl
	- Needs the following modules, installable through cpan (linux, cygwin) 
                                                        or ppm (windows)
		- Regexp::Common
		- XML::DOM
		- XML::LibXML::Reader
		- Tree::Nary
        - if using a Perl package manager to install them, you will also need:
             - GNU gcc and make
             - the development packages for the following libraries  
                -  expat --- pulled in by dependencies to XML::DOM
                -  zlib and xml2  --- pulled in by XML::LibXML::Reader
              
- LaTeX --- optional, but recommended for typesetting definitions 
        -  Besides basic packages, the following (texlive) packages are needed:
           bera datetime ec fancybox fancyvrb import marginnote microtype ms
           pdfcomment pgf preview stmaryrd times titlesec ucs url xcolor 
           xkeyval 

2) Download the architecture specific archive from 
   http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/downloads
and uncompress it somewhere.

Set the PATH
Add the tools directory (from the root of the k-framework directory) to the PATH environment variable

3) To test the installation, execute
  make 
in the regressionTests directory.  All tests should pass

To test the generation of PDFs, execute
  make pdf
in the examples/simple/untyped

This should generate a PDF of the definition which is a good starter for understanding more about K definitions and the process of developing and testing them.
