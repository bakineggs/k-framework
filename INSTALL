To install the K Framework, you simply need this to put this package somewhere on your system and to add the `tools' directory to your path.  

The system is properly installed when you can run "make test" in the /examples directory, and "make" in the /regressionTests directory.

1) Prerequisites:

- GNU make --- to be able to take advantage of the Makefiles provided with the example definitions
- Perl --- as our compilation scripts are writen in Perl
	- Needs the following modules, installable through cpan (linux, cygwin) 
                                                        or ppm (windows)
		- Regexp::Common
		- XML::DOM
		- XML::LibXML::Reader
		- Tree::Nary
        - if using a Perl package manager to install them, you will also need:
             - GNU gcc and make
             - the developement packages for the following libraries  
                -  expat --- pulled in by dependencies to XML::DOM
                -  zlib and xml2  --- pulled in by XML::LibXML::Reader
              
- LaTeX --- optional, but recommended for typesetting definitions 
        -  Besides basic packages, the following (texlive) packages are needed:
           bera datetime ec fancybox fancyvrb import marginnote microtype ms
           pdfcomment pgf preview stmaryrd times titlesec ucs url xcolor 
           xkeyval 

2) Download the architecture specific archive from 
   http://code.google.com/p/k-framework/downloads
and uncompress it somewhere.

3) Setting the PATH
Add the tools directory (from the root of the k-framework directory) to the PATH environment variable

4) Test the installation. 
Execute
  make 
in the regressionTests directory.  All tests should pass

5) To test the generation of PDFs, you execute
  make pdf
in the examples/simple/untyped

This should generate a PDF of the definition which is a good starter for understanding more about K definitions and the process of developing and testing them.

More instructions on writing, compiling, and execution K definitions can be found in the README file.
