To install the K Framework, you simply need this package somewhere on your system.  Your languages will refer to its location.  See the /examples for how this works.

The system is properly installed when you can run "make test" in the /examples directory, and "make" in the /regressionTests directory.

Prerequisites:

- Maude (http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/)
	- Only versions 2.5 and later are supported
- Perl
	- Needs the following modules, installable through cpan (linux, cygwin) or ppm (windows):
		- Regexp::Common
		- XML::DOM
		- XML::LibXML::Reader
		- Tree::Nary
		- Please let us know if you have to install any others.

Optional:

- Haskell (GHC)
	- This is used with the output pretty printer in tools/OutputFilter, and is not required.
