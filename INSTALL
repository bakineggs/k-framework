To install the K Framework, you simply need this package somewhere on your system.  Your languages will refer to its location.  See the /examples for how this works.

The system is properly installed when you can run "make test" in the /examples directory, and "make" in the /regressionTests directory.

Prerequisites:

- Maude (http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/)
	- Only versions 2.5 and later are supported
        - The Maude executable must renamed into `maude` 
          (alternatively, you could create a symbolic link for it,
                       or set $maude_path variable in tools/kompile.pl:26) 
        - the MAUDE_LIB environment variable need to point to the Maude dir

- Perl
	- Needs the following modules, installable through cpan (linux, cygwin) 
                                                        or ppm (windows)
		- Regexp::Common
		- XML::DOM
		- XML::LibXML::Reader
		- Tree::Nary
		- Please let us know if you have to install any others.

Optional:

- Haskell (GHC)
	- This is used with the output pretty printer in tools/OutputFilter, and is not required.


More instructions on witing, compiling, and execution K definitions can be found in the README file.
