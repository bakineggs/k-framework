What it does:
  Filters the output of the k-framework such that only desired information is
  shown. Control over this process is specified in the yaml configuration file,
  which is the second command-line argument. See example.yml
How to build:
  make clean ; make
How to run:
  ./filterOutput <output-file> <yaml-config-file>

Configuration file format:
  Configuration is specified in a yaml document, and has the form:
  <cellname>: <cell-config>
  Where <cell-config> may be be a single command, or a set of options.

  Available single commands are:
    hide                         -- This is the default behavior if a cell is
                                    not specified. Hide the cell and its
                                    immediate content (but proceed as normal for
                                    the cell's children)
    show                         -- Show the cell and it's content (but says
                                    nothing about its children)
    recursively-hide             -- Hide the cell and forcefully hide its
                                    children, undoing any explic shows

  Available options in the set of options:
    keep: <int>                  -- keep only the first <int> number of lines
                                    in the content-text
    cell-style: <cell-style>     -- specify a style for the cell (see below)
    text-style: <text-style>     -- specify a style for the text (see below)

  <cell-style> or <text-style> is a set of any of the following:
    bold: <bold-value>           -- If a true value or "bold", will bold the
                                    cell/text. This can also be "debold", which
                                    will (recursively) undo any previously set
                                    boldening
    underline: <underline-value> -- If a true value or "underline", will
                                    underline the cell/text. This can also be
                                    "deunderline", which will (recursively) undo
                                    any previously set underlineing
    foreground <color>           -- Make the text have <color> as foreground (see
                                    below)
    background <color>           -- Make the text have <color> as background (see
                                    below)

  <color> can be any of the following:
     Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, White, Dullblack, Dullred,
     Dullgreen, Dullyellow, Dullblue, Dullmagenta, Dullcyan, Dullwhite

  Global substitutions can be defined by the special-case cellname:
  "global-substitutions", where you can provide a mapping for string
  replacement, as below:
    global-substitutions:
      old1: new1
      old2: new2
      old3: new3
      ...
