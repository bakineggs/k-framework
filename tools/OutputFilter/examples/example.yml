# Whitelist the following cells
T: show
k:
  keep: 5
env: show
threads: show
thread: show
callStack: recursively-hide
#mem: yes

# Default behavior is to blacklist everything else. Note that neither whitelisting or blacklisting are
# recursive, e.g. blacklisting <thread> wont blacklist all of its children

# Current features:
#   whitelisting
#   keep only a certain number of lines
#   recursive hide


# Upcoming features:
#   colors
#   environment/memory lookup
#   regular-expression based line-based show/hide
#   arbitrary global and local string-replacement rules
