Please report issues here: http://k-framework.googlecode.com, under "issues".
Simply post your test case and briefly explain your problem.  If you have
write permissions to our repository, please also add a test case to the
repository yourself using the directions below (do this in addition to
posting an issue, because you need the issue number).


## Test cases:

When filing a bug, it is important to add an automated test case that
exhibits the bug. This allows us to test our fixes and helps catch
regressions in the future. We use a simple Makefile based test system
that is set up in the following way. If you use our example Makefile
(provided in the example directory and described below) it should be
very easy to add a new test to the system. Just copy and edit. Detailed
descriptions follow.

Test cases for new bugs should be placed in `/trunk/test/issues` in the
following manner:

  $ cd trunk/tests/issues
  $ svn cp example issueXXX

This copies the example test to a new directory so you can edit it.
XXX is intended to be the # of the issue you post on google code.

Now, edit the files in the `issueXXX` directory to reflect your bug.
You must keep the `Makefile`, which you can adjust to suit the filenames
you use.  In your `test.m` file, writing

  rew test1(.List{K}) . ---@ foo 'SomeLabel(.List{K})

causes the test to reduce `test1(.List{K})` and ensures that the result
contains the substring `'SomeLabel(.List{K})`, in addition to naming
the test "foo".  It's parsed like this:

  [rew|red|etc] [testString] . ---@ [testNameWithNoSpaces] [resultString]

Writing:

  rew test1(.List{K}) .

simply checks that it reduces at all.  It's not a very strong test.

Your test is in the correct form if you can type "make true-test"
and an .xml file is created.

  $ cd trunk/tests/issues/issueXXX
  $ make true-test
  $ cat *.xml
  <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>
  <testsuite name='issuexxx.test' time='0'>
    <testcase name='test1' time='0'>
      <failure>Failure</failure>
    </testcase>
    <testcase name='test2' time='0'>
      Success
    </testcase>
  </testsuite>

Since you are adding this test because you have a bug, at least one of
your individual tests should give a failure message.
